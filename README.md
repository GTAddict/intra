# intra
An internal CMS system created in PHP

Helps students in their day-to-day activities and communication. This intra-site also had an e-mail server, radio station and chat server, all of which had 24x7 uptime. [PHP]

This is 5 years old and I lost most of the current code. I wish I had used source control in college. This is a beta version I found.
